## Requirements

- Abell requires [Node.js 8 or higher](https://nodejs.org) installed.

Though it is not "required", if you're using VSCode, it is recommended to have [Abell Language Features Extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=saurabh.abell-language-features) for syntax highlighting of `.abell` files.


## Terms used in Documentation

- **Abell Components** - Abell Components are the `.abell` files with content wrapped inside `<AbellComponent>` tag. Check out [Abell Components Guide](../guide/syntax-guide/#abell-components) for more information. (Usually named as `CamelCased.abell`)
- **Abell Pages** - Abell Pages are close to HTML, they have `<html>` tag and these files eventually become `.html` page in output. (Follow `lowercase.abell` format)
- In documentation, you will find reference of `npx` command which comes along with the Node.js and NPM. It executes the scripts directly.
